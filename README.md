##Phase 2 As-yet-unnamed Personal Project

With this project, I would like to be able to take images and add them to seperate panels on a webpage, resembling a comic or magazine. I would like to add and edit simple shapes like word baloons, text boxes and text to the images.

##Learning objectives/technologies
1. TDD
2. Implement an API for more functionality (if possible).
3. Manage the project well in terms of time and scope.

##MVP
* A user can add images to a page in a grid and add text.
